The issue was caused by an interaction between the `:nth-child` selector and some dynamically added elements.  The solution involves being more specific in the selector to target the desired list items precisely.  Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
#myList > li:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

By adding `#myList >` , we ensure we're only targeting the direct children of the element with the ID `myList`. This eliminates the interference from other elements and provides a consistent selection process.  If you have other interfering classes, add those in the selector to be more specific. 

Note that the ID '#myList' might need to be adapted to match the actual ID of your list element.
